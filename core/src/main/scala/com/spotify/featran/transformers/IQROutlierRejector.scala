 * Reject values if they fall outside of either `factor * IQR` below the first quartile or `factor *

 * IQR or inter quartile range is the range between the first and the third quartiles.

 * The bin ranges are chosen using the Algebird's QTree approximate data structure. The precision of
 * the approximation can be controlled with the `k` parameter.

 * All values are transformed to zeros.

 * rejected as [[FeatureRejection.Outlier]].
 *
 * When using aggregated feature summary from a previous session, values outside of previously seen
 * `[min, max]` will also report [[FeatureRejection.Outlier]] as rejection.
