/**
 * Transform a column of continuous features to n columns of feature buckets.
 *
 * With n+1 splits, there are n buckets. A bucket defined by splits x,y holds values in the range
 * [x,y) except the last bucket, which also includes y. Splits should be strictly increasing. Values
 * at -inf, inf must be explicitly provided to cover all double values; Otherwise,
 * [[FeatureRejection.OutOfBound]] rejection will be reported for values outside the splits
 * specified.. Two examples of splits are `Array(Double.NegativeInfinity, 0.0, 1.0,
 * Double.PositiveInfinity)` and `Array(0.0, 1.0, 2.0)`.
 *
 * Note that if you have no idea of the upper and lower bounds of the targeted column, you should
 * add `Double.NegativeInfinity` and `Double.PositiveInfinity` as the bounds of your splits to
 * prevent a potential [[FeatureRejection.OutOfBound]] rejection.
 *
 * Note also that the splits that you provided have to be in strictly increasing order, i.e. `s0 <
 * s1 < s2 < ... < sn`.
 *
 * Missing values are transformed to zero vectors.
